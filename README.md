    <h2>How the AI Poem Generator Works</h2>
    <p>
      The tool typically operates by analyzing your input prompt and generating verses based on common patterns found in poetry. Depending on the model integrated, results can include rhymed or free-form compositions. GitHub repositories hosting these tools often allow users to clone, modify, or integrate the code with other apps or websites.

      It can serve as a practical tool for students, content marketers, or developers looking to embed poetic generation into larger applications.
